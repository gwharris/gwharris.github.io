      <h1><b>About Me</b></h1>

      <p style="font-size: 115%"><b>Welcome! My name's Graham - I'm a rising junior at NYU majoring in Math and minoring in Computer Science and Italian.</b></p>

      <p>As a student, I spend a lot of time in and out of the classroom working on various projects. When I'm not at school, I enjoy coding, taking care of plants, and trying new food!</p>

      <p><b style="font-size: 115%">Coding: </b>I've been learning how to code for about a year and am always looking for new projects. I have experience in client-side coding and development, and am currently learning web and app development. For example, one of my Covid-19 quarantine projects has been to learn HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript - the result is this website. I pride myself in being able to learn new languages quickly and enjoy picking up new styles of code.</p>

      <p><b style="font-size: 115%">Horticulture: </b>Horticulture is something I've been doing as a hobby for a few years now, but is something I'd love to do professionally. I started out by collecting a couple indoor plants and have begun learning about vegetables and herbs (some of which I use for cocktails!) and even some arbory. I'm fascinated by urban greenspaces, agritech, and green interior design.</p>

      <p><b style="font-size: 115%">Food: </b>As an NYU student, I have access to NYC's rich food scene, which I take advantage of through <a href="#school">Bite Club</a>. Bite Club is a new club at NYU that makes restaurants accessible to our community through partnerships and editorial work. We tackle all sorts of topics ranging from lighthearted trends, fads and recipes, to more serious topics, such as racism and sustainability in the NYC food industry. For the 2020-2021 academic year, I'll be the club's president, and I look forward to trying even more local restaurants and bringing my passion for food to my community.</p>

      <p><b> If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to hearing from you!</b></p>
